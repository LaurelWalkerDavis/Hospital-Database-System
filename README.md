# Hospital Database System

The Hospital Database has been developed to facilitate fast and accurate information storage for a new hospital that services the needs of a rapidly growing retirement community. The  system manages the primary care operation of the hospital, but not the financial operation. It has an easy to use interface that supports all the data entry and information gathering needs of the hospital.
